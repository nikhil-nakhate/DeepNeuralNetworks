# DeepNeuralNetworks
These are are the different neural networks coded in vanilla Java without using any deep learning framework

This code was written jointly by Felipe Gutierrez (git_id: felipegb94) and Nikhil S. Nakhate (git_id: nikhil-nakhate) as
a part of the coursework for CS838.

In addition to the source files, this repo also contains a MakeFile for compilation and a run file that includes the
parameters to be passed.

The first three params would be the train_set, tune_set and test_set respectively and the fourth param would be size of the
images used.
